Wow. Okay, just got out of Snow White and I'm feeling kinda all over the place. That theater popcorn smell is still hanging around, like that ex you can't quite forget, and I'm honestly questioning if I'm more enchanted or bewildered right now. I mean, it's a classic, right? But also, like, how many reboots and spins on this do we need? Remakes, man. They're the reincarnation of exhaustion.

First off, the dwarfs—dwarves?—okay, whatever we're calling them now, were unexpected. Not like, I-didn't-see-that-coming unexpected, more like my-brain-didn't-process-before-laughing unexpected. Someone clearly had too much fun in the costume department, which I respect. Costumes were on point; hats off (or your entire wardrobe, perhaps). And Snow White herself... well, I kinda wanted to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later just to pause and stare—her expressions said more than my mother-in-law during a family dinner.

> So, the forest scenes felt like getting lost in my aunt's backyard after a rowdy wedding. Trees everywhere, kind of comforting but overwhelmingly confusing. One moment I'm trying to admire the beauty and the next I'm wondering if there’s WiFi out there, or if the seven dwarfs have 𝘕𝘦𝘵𝘧𝘭𝘪𝘹 subscriptions. 

Okay, and let's discuss the handsome prince. Dude needs a new wardrobe stylist. That puffy shirt looked like it was pulled out of a pirate's closet meets a Shakespearean reject. But hey, he had some charm. Not saying I'd say yes to a proposal just after waking up from a nap courtesy of a poisoned apple, but who am I to question fairy tale logic? Also, anyone else thought the evil queen was trying way too hard? Like on a scale of one to power-hungry, she was sipping an extra caffeine shot.

There was this one scene where the animals, little woodland critters or whatever, were acting suspiciously organized and I'm thinking they've got a hidden agenda. Bet they're the real masterminds, just biding time till they launch their political career as a collective. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and you'll see what I mean.

```c
#include magic_mirror.h
bool isFairest(string person) {
    return (person == Snow White);
}
```

And the music? Oh, boy, the soundtrack was like a mixed bag of fruit from the farmer's market—some sweet, some dodgy. Makes me want to awkwardly frolic through the fields or maybe just, you know, tantrum-flop onto my living room couch after a long day.

Okay, I need to collect myself. Might grab a coffee or five, or find a place where I can pretend to be intellectual and discuss allegories or the lack thereof. Feel like I just walked through a dream I both understood and didn't, but it'll stick with me. Until the next reboot, anyway.
